Schneider Electric suffered a Data Breach from Hellcat Ransomware Group! 
Hellcat Ransomware Group published data on their new Domain!

ðŸ’¡Here is the short summary:-

ðŸ“ŒThe group initially demanded $125,000 when it got listed on 4th November 2024.
ðŸ“ŒHellcat had mentioned the current CEO "Olivier Blum" in their blog post. 
ðŸ“ŒThe group also tried to mention the victim on Twitter, about the leak, but it did not gained much impressions.
ðŸ“ŒFrom the sample image shared, it is found that the group had infiltrated JIRA Server and Gravatar Platform which also exposed the clients of Schneider Electric.  
ðŸ“ŒThey did not received the ransom till 8th November and released the data ~40GB (Compressed) via Magnet Link ðŸ§².
ðŸ“ŒAs there were no enough peers/seeds available, they have removed it. 
ðŸ“ŒNow they have hosted the data on a new Onion Domain and a direct download is enabled (which is again low, depends on bandwidth)
ðŸ“ŒEarlier, Cactus Ransomware Group also infiltrated Schneider Electric France and claimed 1.5TB data in January 2024.

Hence, the group had desperately waited for long! But unlike BlackCat, LockBit or DarkAngels, they failed to extort money from Schneider Electric, thinking the corporate would pay the ransom!

UPDATE 1:

ðŸš¨Hellcat launched new Website with affiliates from Breach Forum
================================================================

hellcat[.]rw

ðŸ’¡The group had launched their domain on Surface web, deactivating their Onion domain (at present). 
ðŸ’¡The TLD used is RW which is the country TLD of Rwanda, but we can also see it as a short form of "Ransomware" to match the TLD. 
ðŸ’¡The domain is registered with AOS (based in Rwanda) by concealing the identity with CloudFlare services
ðŸ’¡7 Members are listed on their website, who are the members of Breach Forum previously who had done significant breaches in the past
ðŸ’¡The group claims to be ransomware, but there is no encryptor available. Hence, it could be the collection of previous leaks, now re-branding under Ransomware. 
ðŸ“ŒSome of the members with past activities are:-
